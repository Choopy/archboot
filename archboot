 Welcome in archboot, a script made with love by ${__author__}
${nc}
Arch Linux is a light and fast distribution whose concept
is to remain  as simple  as possible. In the same purpose
this  script  performs  minimalist  installation, it only
installs the  required  packages, in order  to  give free
choice  to the  user. Pretty simple, it just prompts  for
language, hostname, username, which disk to use, required
partitions size  and  if  you wish  to install  a desktop
environment. According to the chosen one  and in order to
get complete support, additional packages may be required
For more  information, take a look  at the  archboot wiki

#                      ARCHBOOT SYSTEM MANAGEMENT
# ============================================================================
# Here we defined all required variables and functions to manage archboot.
# Variables are pretty simple such as define needed url and colors.
# Functions are used to display install steps, notes, errors or to do some
# actions like cleanup after fatal error, execute cmd in chrooted environment,
# select an option, ask some information to the user or to get install logs.
